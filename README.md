# DSP332_Practical_Assignment_1

This assignment allows students to apply in practice their knowledge of search-based problem-solving by developing a game software. The students have to design and develop a two-person game with perfect information, in which a computer plays against a human. The student team receives a description of the game from the teacher. The student team is free to choose the programming language or environment to develop the software. 

It is mandatory to provide in the software the following options to the user: 

to choose who starts the game: human-user or computer;
to choose which algorithm the computer will use: the Minimax algorithm or the Alpha-Beta algorithm;
to make moves and see changes in the course of the game after the human-user's moves and the computer's moves;
to start a new game after the current game has been completed.
The software must provide a graphical user interface (command line games will not be accepted). In this case, it is not about a complex, 3D graphical interface but about the use of visual elements such as menus, buttons, text fields, icons, lists, etc. 

When developing software, the student team must implement the following:

storing the game tree or part of it as a data structure (classes, linked lists). The work will not be accepted and evaluated if a set of variables is used instead of a data structure;
generation of a game tree or part of it, depending on the complexity of the game and the computational resources available to the student team;
the development of a heuristic evaluation function;
the implementation of the Minimax algorithm and the Alpha-beta algorithm (both of which can be implemented as N-ply look ahead);
10 experiments with each of the algorithms, recording the number of computer and human victories, the number of nodes visited by the computer in each game, the average time taken by the computer to execute a move.
Thus, the following steps must be followed by the student team in developing the assignment:

get a game from the teacher;
choose a programming environment/language;
design a data structure for storing states of the game;
design, implement and test the game algorithms;
experiment with both algorithms;
prepare a report on the game and submit it to the e-course;
answer questions about the use of AI tools in the game development;
make peer-assessment;
apply for a defence time;
defend the assignment.
